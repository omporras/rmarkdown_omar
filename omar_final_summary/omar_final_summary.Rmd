# Introduction
Introduce *yourself*. What's your background? Could you code before Data School? What did your 
daily work pattern look like before Data School? Etc. This section will be placed in 
an introductory block at the top of the page separate from the rest of the content. Don't change the section title from "Introduction" otherwise this process won't work correctly.

# My Project
Rather than yourself, this is the space to introduce your **project**. What are 
your goals, what was your data, how do you plan to work with it? Perhaps show some example data if 
it would help.

In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
